# Typst Upgrade

Help you to upgrade your Typst Packages.

## Usage

To detect the upgradeable packages in your typst project, run the following command (assuming `main.typ` is the entry point of your project):

```console
$ typst-upgrade run main.typ -d
```

> dry-run is required now since in-place upgrade is not implemented yet
